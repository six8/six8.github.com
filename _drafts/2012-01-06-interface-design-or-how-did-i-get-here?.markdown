I'm not an interface design expert. But I am, like every user, an expert user. As a user, I do stupid things and I have no idea how I got here and what I should be doing here. So here's a few simple notes to make it easier the next time I bump in to your corner of the web.

- First answer: Why am I here and why should I come here again?
- Why should I be a user for your site - what value will I get from it?
- Once I'm a user, what should I do while I'm here?
- When I come back, things I do every day I want to get to in one click
