Title: About

Hi, I'm Mike Thornton ([@mikeatmassive](https://twitter.com/mikeatmassive))

I create software and I write about it.

That pretty much sums it up, but you may want some more details.

I'm an aspiring entrepreneur and co-founder of [Massive Foundry](http://massivefoundry.com). I'm an avid Python developer. I've also worked with iOS, PHP, Java, and many other web and mobile based technologies. I like solving problems, the bigger the better.  I've also contributed to several open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/six8/). Occasionally I write things on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mikeatmassive).
