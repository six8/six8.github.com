    <p>I write lots of code.</p>
    <p>That pretty much sums it up, but you may want some more details.</p>
    <p>I'm an avid Python developer. I've also worked in PHP, Java, and many other web based
    technologies. I like solving problems, the bigger the better. I've been pretty dormant in
    developer communities. Now is the time to rectify that.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I borrowed this <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> template from <a href="http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/01/26/my-new-jekyll-blog/">James Yu</a>. With this template and instructions like <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll">How To: WordPress to Jekyll</a>. I had this blog set up in a couple hours. I'll eventually make it my own.</p>
